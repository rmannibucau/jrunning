= JRunning

JRunning aims to provide a simple, easy and Open Sourced running application.

It is composed of two main parts:

- mobile: the android application you install on your phone
- server: the server to deploy somewhere to collect the data

== Mobile

NOTE: only Android is supported today

Mobile application is quite trivial today. You configure a server and your credentials and you have 3 buttons:

- Start
- Stop
- Quit

Under these 3 buttons you have a small detail panel (mainly debug panel ATM) with few information about the last received point.

NOTE: location is taken from the GPS of your phone.

== Server

Server is under development. It only provide an endpoint matching mobile application expectation for now but it will soon
go further providing a nice front and some more advanced features.

== Wish list

- phantom mode
- google map integration
- history management
- statistic computing
- reuse google account?
- ...
