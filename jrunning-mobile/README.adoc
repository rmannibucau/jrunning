== Build

[source]
----
mvn install
----

== Debug

[source]
----
mvn install android:deploy -Dandroid.device=emulator
----

NOTE: `-Dandroid.device=usb` will use a connected phone.

Then open your application in your IDE, open DDMS and select the application to get the port number (on the right).

Finally configure a remote connection in your IDE.

== How can you help?

- Testing
- Simplifying setup (mvn good-plugin:setup which would download and install android-sdk + the right version would be awesome)
- Better GUI (a good map when the server will be able to return enough data for instance)
- More features
- Supporting SSL
- Any other good idea...
